# terms-of-service
A record of Terms of Service agreements from different companies. The goal for this project is to provide TOS updates to users where they can see a diff of what has changed since the last version they agreed to. In most cases, large companies have massive pieces of text for their TOS and it is hard to understand what a company is trying to accomplish when they change their TOS. It would be much better easier to understand a TOS document if you could see the changes that have occurred since the last version in an easy to read format. 

# Current Status
Right now this repository is very much a work in progress and I am trying to determine the best way to collect and display this data. 

If you would like to help brainstorm the future of this project please take a look at the first group of files I have collected from the Facebook terms of service in the [history](https://github.com/davidargylethacker/terms-of-service/tree/develop/companies/facebook/history) folder for their company. As well as the compiled change log of each of the updates to their TOS shown by the [changes](https://github.com/davidargylethacker/terms-of-service/blob/develop/companies/facebook/change/terms_of_service_changes) file. You can also see a sample of what a diff might look like here by viewing one of commit links, such as [this one](https://github.com/davidargylethacker/terms-of-service/commit/1918510030cb37fcd3732e7e065aabc741d615e3#diff-9b11e2ef8e00f8297e45ad5cf43167f9). 

All ideas, pull requests, and critiques are welcome!

# Further TODO
- What is the best way to download TOS files from different websites?
- Is it best to store only the TOS text, the full html file, or both?
- How often should we search for and download TOS agreements?
