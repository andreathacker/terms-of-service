# terms-of-service
A record of many Terms of Service agreements from different companies. 

Right now this repository is very much a work in progress and I am trying to determine the best way to collect and display this data. 

If you would like to help brainstorm the future of this project please take a look at the first group of files I have collected from the Facebook terms of service in the [history](https://github.com/davidargylethacker/terms-of-service/tree/develop/companies/facebook/history) folder for their company. As well as the compiled change log of each of the updates to their TOS shown by the [changes](https://github.com/davidargylethacker/terms-of-service/blob/develop/companies/facebook/change/terms_of_service_changes) file. You can also see a sample of what a diff might look like here by viewing one of commit links, such as [this one](https://github.com/davidargylethacker/terms-of-service/commit/1918510030cb37fcd3732e7e065aabc741d615e3#diff-9b11e2ef8e00f8297e45ad5cf43167f9). 

All ideas, pull requests, and critiques are welcome!
